## Experience

I have worked as a freelancer on Upwork since June 2024 and have completed three projects, all of which earned me 5-star reviews.

### First project

Rewriting a Figma design into HTML/TailwindCSS.

### Second project

This one was more advanced - helping to develop an MS Word add-in related to AI. It was team-based work. My responsibilities included:

- Fixing bugs
- Adding minor UX improvements
- Adjusting the frontend to the backend

### Third project

I created a landing page website for a newly created startup company co-founded by my classmate.

### Before Upwork

I created a website for the trade union in my city. I am not allowed to show the source code, but you can see the final result here: [zzpumk.lm.pl](https://www.zzpumk.lm.pl/).
